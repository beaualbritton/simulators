# simulators

Suite of hardware simulators I developed to deepen my understanding of **systems programming** and the **boundary between hardware and software**.  
These projects cover cache design, instruction pipelining, branch prediction, and GPU acceleration, with performance analysis and visualizations.

## Projects

- **Cache Simulator (C++)**  
  - Set-associative and direct-mapped designs  
  - Models **write-back** and **write-through** logic  

- **RISC-V Instruction Pipeline (C & Python)**  
  - Pipeline simulator in both languages  
  - Compares **accuracy** and **runtime performance**  

- **Branch Predictor (C++ & Python)**  
  - N-bit predictor implementations (0â€“3 bit) in C++
  - Visualized with Python's **matplotlib** performance charts  

- **CUDA Parallelism (CUDA C++)**  
  - Matrix-vector multiplication and vector addition kernels  
  - Demonstrates **GPU speedup vs CPU**
